# it will get the payment_intent_id, maybe user id or unique id and it will need user_bookings.py url 

#  it will call the server.py where this service sends the needed details over to server.py to process refund and return code 200 and then after that it will either remove the booking from user_bookings,

# thinking if we should add another microservice to store all the cancel booking for user to see the refund status and stuff.
